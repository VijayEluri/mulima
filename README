Mulima (Music Library Manager)
org.mulima

This is a free (GPLv3 licensed) tool to manage your music library.  Your master copies are maintained in FLAC images with metadata stored in XML files.  The Music Library Manager can then maintain copies in different formats (e.g. for iPod, desktop, etc.).

To do the file conversions it uses codecs installed on your computer.

NOTE: Right now this is a work in progress. It is not ready for use.
